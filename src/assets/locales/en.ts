      "description": "Graduated from a Bachelor Gobelins Interactive Developer, I am passionate about programming since high school when I made a website to showcase my graduation project. Having enjoyed developing it, I oriented my studies around this field to learn more about it. From Wordpress to React, through Unity, I discovered many technologies during my 3 years of study and was also able to put them into practice during my 2 years of apprenticeship in the AC Web Design agency.{br}{br}During my last year of studies, I discovered mobile application programming and game development with Unity, Swift, but also Android Studio which gave me the desire to learn more about those two subjects. I also realized an interactive augmented reality experience with Les Naufragés for Annecy paysages, an outdoor festival in the city of Annecy.",
