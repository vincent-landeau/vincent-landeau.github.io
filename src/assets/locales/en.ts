      "description": "Graduated from a Bachelor Gobelins Interactive Developer, I am passionate about programming since high school when I made a website to showcase my graduation project. Having enjoyed developing it, I oriented my studies around this field to learn more about it. From Wordpress to React, through Unity, I discovered many technologies during my 3 years of study and was also able to put them into practice during my 2 years of apprenticeship in the AC Web Design agency.{br}{br}During my last year of studies, I discovered mobile application programming and game development with Unity, Swift, but also Android Studio which gave me the desire to learn more about those two subjects. I also realized an interactive augmented reality experience with Les Naufragés for Annecy paysages, an outdoor festival in the city of Annecy.",

On the right, you can see a very intriguing dashboard. Once the throttle is activated, a hatch opens, releasing the heart of the France, which flies off towards the lake. A circle appears, inviting me to touch it at a specific moment to help the heart beat again. With each successful touch, we see a structure forming around the heart. Could this be the new shape of the France? Once the structure has fully returned, it disappears to make way for the France of yesteryear, which we can then contemplate. A screen appears congratulating us on having successfully completed the experiment and inviting us to visit a website retracing the history of the France."
